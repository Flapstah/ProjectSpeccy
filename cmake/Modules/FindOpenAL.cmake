# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of 
# OPENAL_LIBRARY to override this selection.
# Tiger will include OpenAL as part of the System.
# But for now, we have to look around.
# Other (Unix) systems should be able to utilize the non-framework paths.
